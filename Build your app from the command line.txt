You can execute all the build tasks available to your Android project using the Gradle wrapper command line tool. It's available as a batch file for Windows (gradlew.bat) and a shell script for Linux and Mac (gradlew.sh), and it's accessible from the root of each project you create with Android Studio.

To run a task with the wrapper, use one of the following commands from a Terminal window (from Android Studio, select View > Tool Windows > Terminal):


On Windows: 

gradlew task-name


On Mac or Linux: 

./gradlew task-name
